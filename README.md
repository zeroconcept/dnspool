An automated hosts scripts which downloading, parsing, merging, and de-duplicating the hosts list from various sources.

My project aims will always be as following
- Dynamic in coding == flexible && lesser maintenance,
- Resources alert == optimization in coding so that it not only achieve the task, it use better approach to finish the task quickly, mitigate resources intensive
- Educational / knowledge value == Using difference code technique and style so that we can learn difference and new alternative way on handling task together :)

Get started
============
Edit the bash file using your favourite editor and insert the URLs into the bash scripts
- URL File, in the development process
- URL ended with "zip" is supported, but currently its only hard-coded with file name "hosts.txt"

Run the scripts, and it will automatically does its job.



How it works
============
The supported format of the hosts file is: SOURCE DOMAIN HOSTNAMES. (for example: /etc/hosts format)
my scripts will only accept the sources line started with "127.0.0.1" and "0.0.0.0"
